# How it was developed
This tool uses simple javascript control over an svg file, and has been made responsive via bootstrap to be compatible with both smartphones and PC. It is also based upon http://sebmatton.github.io/flightindicators/ .
The indicators design was made to be as similar as possible to the israeli T-6 Texan II one's.
